class UCF101(VisionDataset):
    """
    `UCF101 <https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php>`_ dataset.

    UCF101 is an action recognition video dataset.
    This dataset consider every video as a collection of video clips of fixed size, specified
    by ``frames_per_clip``, where the step in frames between each clip is given by
    ``step_between_clips``.

    To give an example, for 2 videos with 10 and 15 frames respectively, if ``frames_per_clip=5``
    and ``step_between_clips=5``, the dataset size will be (2 + 3) = 5, where the first two
    elements will come from video 1, and the next three elements from video 2.
    Note that we drop clips which do not have exactly ``frames_per_clip`` elements, so not all
    frames in a video might be present.

    Internally, it uses a VideoClips object to handle clip creation.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the UCF101 Dataset.
        annotation_path (str): path to the folder containing the split files
        frames_per_clip (int): number of frames in a clip.
        step_between_clips (int, optional): number of frames between each clip.
        fold (int, optional): which fold to use. Should be between 1 and 3.
        train (bool, optional): if ``True``, creates a dataset from the train split,
            otherwise from the ``test`` split.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in a TxHxWxC video
            and returns a transformed version.

    Returns:
        video (Tensor[T, H, W, C]): the `T` video frames
        audio(Tensor[K, L]): the audio frames, where `K` is the number of channels
            and `L` is the number of points
        label (int): class of the video clip
